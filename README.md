# Evaluation of PINNs for Solving PDEs

## Project Description

This project presents a comparative evaluation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and classical Finite Difference Methods (Explicit, Implicit, and Crank–Nicolson) for solving 1D, 2D, and 3D heat equations under coarse discretization, benchmarking accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. The study analyzes analytical solutions, implements full numerical solvers, builds dimensional PINN architectures with adaptive loss balancing, and provides a systematic performance comparison across dimensions to highlight the practical strengths and limitations of both approaches.

This work was carried out as my **Final Year Project (MATH 499) and submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS**.
